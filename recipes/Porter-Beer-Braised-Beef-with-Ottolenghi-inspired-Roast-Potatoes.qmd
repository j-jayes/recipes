## Main Course: Porter Beer-Braised Beef with Ottolenghi-inspired Roast Potatoes

Ingredients:

- 1.5kg beef roast (such as topside or rib-eye)

- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

- 3 tbsp olive oil

- 1.2kg small waxy potatoes, peeled and halved

- 2 tbsp za'atar

- 1 tbsp sumac

- Zest of 1 lemon

- 3 tbsp chopped fresh parsley

- 2 bottles (24 oz) porter beer

- 3 celery stalks, chopped

- 2 onions, chopped

- 3 carrots, chopped

For the gravy:

- Drippings from the beef

- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour

- 1 cup beef broth

- Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions: 

1. Season the beef roast generously with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Sear the beef on all sides until browned, about 3-4 minutes per side. 

2. Add the porter beer to the pot, followed by the chopped celery, onions, and carrots. The beer should cover the beef roast. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let it simmer for 2.5 to 3 hours, or until the beef is fork-tender. 

3. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F). 

4. Prepare the roast potatoes. In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil, za'atar, sumac, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Spread the potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast for 35-40 minutes, or until golden and crispy, turning them halfway through cooking. 

5. Remove the beef from the pot and place it on a cutting board. Tent with foil, and let it rest for 15-20 minutes. 

6. While the beef is resting, prepare the gravy. Strain the cooking liquid from the pot into a bowl, reserving the vegetables. Skim off any fat from the surface of the liquid. 

7. In the same pot, heat 2 tbsp of the beef drippings over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the reserved cooking liquid and beef broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the gravy has thickened, about 5-10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 

8. To serve, slice the beef roast and arrange on a platter with the roasted potatoes and reserved vegetables. Sprinkle the potatoes with lemon zest and chopped parsley. Serve the gravy alongside the beef.

## Broccoli, Peas, and Mixed Greens Salad with Pomegranate Arils

Ingredients:

- 1 large head of broccoli, cut into small florets

- 1 cup frozen peas, thawed

- 4 cups mixed greens (such as spinach, arugula, and baby kale)

- 1 cup pomegranate arils

- 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (optional)

For the dressing:

- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

- 2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice

- 1 tbsp honey

- 1 small garlic clove, minced

- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Instructions: 

1. Microwave the peas in a bowl of water, up to the level of covering the peas, for 8-12 minutes. Drain water and let cool.

2. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli florets and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until they're bright green and slightly tender. Drain the broccoli and immediately transfer it to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Let the broccoli sit in the ice water for a minute and then drain. 

3. In a large salad bowl, combine the blanched broccoli, cooked peas, mixed greens, and pomegranate arils. If desired, add crumbled feta cheese for extra flavor and texture. 

4. Prepare the dressing by whisking together the extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice, honey, minced garlic, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. 

5. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to combine. Serve the salad alongside the porter beer-braised beef and Ottolenghi-inspired roast potatoes. Enjoy!
