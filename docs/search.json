Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Sear the beef on all sides until browned, about 3-4 minutes per side.\nAdd the porter beer to the pot, followed by the chopped celery, onions, and carrots. The beer should cover the beef roast. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let it simmer for 2.5 to 3 hours, or until the beef is fork-tender.\nPreheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).\nPrepare the roast potatoes. In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil, za’atar, sumac, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Spread the potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast for 35-40 minutes, or until golden and crispy, turning them halfway through cooking.\nRemove the beef from the pot and place it on a cutting board. Tent with foil, and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.\nWhile the beef is resting, prepare the gravy. Strain the cooking liquid from the pot into a bowl, reserving the vegetables. Skim off any fat from the surface of the liquid.\nIn the same pot, heat 2 tbsp of the beef drippings over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the reserved cooking liquid and beef broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the gravy has thickened, about 5-10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nTo serve, slice the beef roast and arrange on a platter with the roasted potatoes and reserved vegetables. Sprinkle the potatoes with lemon zest and chopped parsley. Serve the gravy alongside the beef."
