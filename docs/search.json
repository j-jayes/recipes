Skim off any fat from the surface of the liquid.\nIn the same pot, heat 2 tbsp of the beef drippings over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the reserved cooking liquid and beef broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the gravy has thickened, about 5-10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nTo serve, slice the beef roast and arrange on a platter with the roasted potatoes and reserved vegetables. Sprinkle the potatoes with lemon zest and chopped parsley. Serve the gravy alongside the beef."

    "text": "Excited to be going to the Drakensberg with some special friends this weekend!\nRecipes drawn from the best meals that I have enjoyed at Champagne Sports with family, as well as tasty restaurants in Cape Town and Copenhagen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday Lunch: Deconstructed “Club Kloof” Platter\nThis is not so much a recipe as an assembly. Slow-roast the tomatoes until they are sweet and jammy. The capers are fried until they burst open like salty, crispy flowers.\n\n\n\nIngredients\nFor the Confit Tomatoes:\n\n800g cherry tomatoes\n4 cloves of garlic, peeled and smashed\n4 sprigs of thyme\n120ml extra virgin olive oil\n1 tsp light brown sugar\nSalt and black pepper\n\nFor the Crispy Capers:\n\n4 tbsp capers in brine, drained\n100ml sunflower oil\n\n\n\n\nFor Assembly:\n\n1 large ball of fresh burrata or fior di latte\nA generous handful of fresh basil leaves\nHigh-quality sourdough or ciabatta\nGluten-free crackers\nYour best extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor Ineke: The burrata is the only conflict here. To supplement, provide a bowl of good quality hummus (seasoned with lemon, salt, and chilli) as a creamy, plant-based alternative for her.\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nFor the confit tomatoes (Prep Ahead): Preheat your oven to 150°C (130°C fan). Place the tomatoes in a snug-fitting baking dish. Tuck the smashed garlic cloves and thyme sprigs in amongst them. Drizzle generously with the olive oil, sprinkle over the sugar, a good pinch of salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Toss gently. Roast for 1.5–2 hours, until the tomatoes are softened, slightly shrivelled, and intensely flavourful. Let them cool completely in their oil. This can be done up to three days in advance and stored in a sealed jar in the fridge.\nFor the crispy capers (Prep Ahead): Pat the drained capers completely dry with a paper towel—this is crucial for crisping and preventing oil splatters. Heat the sunflower oil in a small saucepan over a medium-high heat. Test the oil with one caper; it should sizzle immediately. Carefully add the rest of the capers and fry for 2–3 minutes, until they have ‘bloomed’ and look crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. They will crisp up further as they cool. Store in an airtight container.\nTo assemble: Let the burrata come to room temperature for 20 minutes for the best flavour and texture. Place it on a platter and gently tear it open. Spoon the confit tomatoes and their glorious oil all around it. Scatter with the fresh basil leaves and, finally, the crispy capers. Serve with the bread and crackers on the side.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday Dinner: Spatchcock Chicken with Potatoes in its Drippings\nThere are few things in life as comforting as a roast chicken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAdapting for Ineke: This meal requires a parallel main course. You will roast Ineke’s potatoes on a separate tray with olive oil and provide a beautiful piece of pan-seared fish instead of chicken. A bright salsa verde will replace the chicken gravy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredients\n\n1 large free-range chicken (around 1.6kg)\n700g baby potatoes, scrubbed\n2 lemons\n1 whole bulb of garlic, halved crossways\n4 sprigs of thyme, plus extra for potatoes\n\nFor the Herb Butter:\n\n80g unsalted butter, at room temperature\n4 cloves garlic, crushed\n1 tbsp thyme leaves, finely chopped\nZest of 1 lemon\n1 tsp salt\n½ tsp black pepper\n\nFor Ineke’s Main:\n\n1 large fillet of fish salmon\n1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for potatoes\n1 clove garlic, crushed\nA few sprigs of thyme\n\n\n\n\nFor the Greens:\n\n400g Tenderstem broccoli or green beans\n1 tbsp olive oil\n1 clove garlic, thinly sliced\n\nFor the Gravy:\n\n1 tbsp cornflour\n250ml chicken stock or water\n\nFor the Salsa Verde (for fish):\n\n1 large bunch of flat-leaf parsley\n2 tbsp capers, drained\n1 clove garlic\nJuice of ½ a lemon\n4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nPrepare the chicken (On the Day): Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C fan). First, make the herb butter by mixing all its ingredients in a small bowl.\nPlace the chicken breast-side down on a board. Using sturdy kitchen shears, cut along both sides of the backbone to remove it. Flip the chicken over and press down firmly on the breastbone to flatten it. Pat the chicken dry all over with paper towels.\nGently loosen the skin over the breasts and thighs and push half of the herb butter underneath. Rub the remaining butter all over the outside of the chicken. Season generously.\nPrepare the potatoes: Cut any larger potatoes in half and place them in a pot of cold salted water. Bring to the boil and cook for 10 minutes until slightly tender. Drain well and shake the colander to rough up their edges.\nRoast: Tip the par-boiled potatoes into a large roasting tin. Add the halved garlic bulb and extra thyme sprigs. Drizzle with a little olive oil. Place a wire rack over the potatoes and place the spatchcocked chicken on top. Squeeze the juice of one lemon over the chicken. Roast for 50–60 minutes, or until the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pierced.\n\n\nFor Ineke, toss her portion of potatoes on a separate, smaller baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil, a few smashed garlic cloves, and thyme.\n\n\nRest and finish: Remove the chicken to a board to rest for 15 minutes. You can place the potatoes back in the oven to crisp up further if needed. While the chicken rests, sauté your greens with the sliced garlic until tender-crisp.\nFor the gravy: Spoon off most of the fat from the roasting tin. Place the tin over a medium heat. Mix the cornflour with a little cold water to make a slurry, then whisk it into the tin with the chicken stock, scraping up all the caramelised bits from the bottom. Simmer for a few minutes until thickened.\n\nFor the salsa verde, blitz all the ingredients in a food processor until you have a rough sauce. Season to taste.\n\nCarve the chicken and serve with the incredible potatoes, greens, and the pan gravy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday Lunch: Mushroom Pâté & Seed Tartlets on Puff Pastry\nThis starter is an exercise in umami. The seeds on top add a nice crunch.\n\n\n\nIngredients\n\n1 sheet of all-butter puff pastry, thawed\n1 egg, beaten\n1 tbsp sunflower seeds (or a mix of seeds)\n\nFor the Mushroom Pâté:\n\n2 tbsp olive oil\n500g mixed mushrooms (like portabellini and exotic), roughly chopped\n2 shallots or 1 small onion, finely chopped\n2 cloves garlic, crushed\n1 tbsp thyme leaves\n1 tsp soy sauce\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nMake the mushroom pâté (Prep Ahead): Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook for 5 minutes until soft. Add the chopped mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10–15 minutes. The mushrooms will first release a lot of water; continue cooking until all the water has evaporated and the mushrooms start to caramelise and turn golden brown.\nAdd the garlic and thyme and cook for another minute until fragrant. Add the soy sauce and a generous amount of salt and pepper. Stir well.\nTransfer the mushroom mixture to a food processor. Pulse a few times until you have a coarse, spreadable pâté. You don’t want a perfectly smooth puree. Let it cool completely. This can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 days.\nAssemble and bake (On the Day): Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C fan). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nUnroll the puff pastry sheet. You can either cut it into small squares or rounds for individual tartlets, or leave it whole for a larger tart to slice. Place the pastry on the prepared baking sheet.\nSpread the cooled mushroom pâté over the pastry, leaving a 1cm border around the edge.\nBrush the border with the beaten egg. Sprinkle the sunflower seeds over the mushroom pâté.\nBake for 15–20 minutes, until the pastry is puffed up, deeply golden, and crisp. Serve warm.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday Lunch Starter: Tempura Cauliflower with Tahini & Chilli Crunch\nInspired by a meal at Kima in CPH.\n\n\n\nIngredients\n\n1 head of cauliflower, broken into bite-sized florets\n1 litre sunflower oil, for frying\n\nFor the Tempura Batter:\n\n100g plain flour (or GF flour mix)\n50g cornflour\n½ tsp salt\n200ml ice-cold sparkling water\n\nFor the Tahini Sauce & Garnish:\n\n3 tbsp tahini\n1 clove garlic, crushed\nJuice of ½ a lemon\n2–3 tbsp water, to thin\nSalt\nChilli Crunch, to serve\nHandful of fresh coriander or parsley, chopped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nMake the tahini sauce (Prep Ahead): In a small bowl, whisk together the tahini, crushed garlic, and lemon juice. It will seize up and become thick—this is normal. Gradually whisk in the cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until you have a smooth, pourable sauce the consistency of single cream. Season with salt.\nPrepare for frying (On the Day): Heat the sunflower oil in a large, deep saucepan to 180°C. If you don’t have a thermometer, a small drop of batter should sizzle and turn golden in about 30 seconds.\nMake the batter: Just before you are ready to fry, whisk the flour, cornflour, and salt together in a bowl. Gently pour in the ice-cold sparkling water and whisk very lightly. A few lumps are perfectly fine; over-mixing will make the batter heavy.\nFry the cauliflower: Working in batches, dip the cauliflower florets into the batter, letting any excess drip off. Carefully place them in the hot oil. Fry for 3–4 minutes, turning occasionally, until light golden and very crisp. Do not overcrowd the pan.\nRemove the fried florets with a slotted spoon to a wire rack to drain. Sprinkle immediately with a little salt.\nTo serve: Arrange the hot tempura cauliflower on a platter. Drizzle generously with the tahini sauce, spoon over some of the chilli crunch, and finish with a scattering of fresh herbs. Serve immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday Lunch Main: Fragrant Thai Curry with Pan-Seared Halibut\nBased on Kathy’s birthday meal at the Pot Luck Club.\n\n\n\nIngredients\n\n2 x 180g halibut fillets, skin on\n200g raw, peeled prawns\n1 tbsp sunflower oil\nSteamed jasmine rice, to serve\n\nFor the Curry Sauce:\n\n1 tbsp coconut or sunflower oil\n2 cloves garlic, finely grated\n2cm piece of ginger, finely grated\n3-4 tbsp red Thai curry paste\n400ml can full-fat coconut milk\n200ml vegetable or chicken stock\n1 tsp brown sugar\nJuice of 1 lime\n\nTo Finish:\n\nA large handful of fresh coriander, roughly chopped\nA few fresh basil leaves (Thai basil if you can find it)\n1 fresh red chilli, thinly sliced (optional)\nLime wedges, to serve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nStart the jasmine rice according to packet instructions so it is ready when the curry is.\nBuild the curry base: Heat the coconut oil in a saucepan or wok over a medium heat. Add the grated garlic and ginger and fry for a minute until fragrant. Add the curry paste and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring, until it darkens and becomes very aromatic.\nPour in the coconut milk and stock, whisking to combine with the paste. Bring to a gentle simmer, then add the brown sugar. Let it simmer gently for 10 minutes for the flavours to meld.\nCook the seafood: While the sauce simmers, prepare the halibut. Pat the skin completely dry with a paper towel and season the fillets with salt. Heat the sunflower oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Place the halibut skin-side down and press gently with a spatula for 30 seconds to ensure it’s flat against the pan. Cook for 3–4 minutes, until the skin is golden and very crisp. Flip and cook for another 1–2 minutes, depending on the thickness, until just cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.\nFinish the sauce: Add the raw prawns to the simmering curry sauce and cook for just 2–3 minutes, until they turn pink and opaque. Stir in the fresh lime juice.\nTo serve: Ladle the jasmine rice into shallow bowls. Spoon the fragrant curry and prawns over the rice. Gently place a piece of crispy-skinned halibut on top of each bowl. Garnish generously with the fresh coriander, basil, and sliced chilli. Serve immediately with extra lime wedges on the side."

    "text": "Excited to be going to the Drakensberg with some special friends this weekend!\nRecipes drawn from the best meals that I have enjoyed at Champagne Sports with family, as well as tasty restaurants in Cape Town and Copenhagen.\n\n\n\nThis is not so much a recipe as an assembly. Slow-roast the tomatoes until they are sweet and jammy. The capers are fried until they burst open like salty, crispy flowers.\n\n\n\n\nFor the Confit Tomatoes:\n\n800g cherry tomatoes\n4 cloves of garlic, peeled and smashed\n4 sprigs of thyme\n120ml extra virgin olive oil\n1 tsp light brown sugar\nSalt and black pepper\n\nFor the Crispy Capers:\n\n4 tbsp capers in brine, drained\n100ml sunflower oil\n\n\n\n\nFor Assembly:\n\n1 large ball of fresh burrata or fior di latte\nA generous handful of fresh basil leaves\nHigh-quality sourdough or ciabatta\nGluten-free crackers\nYour best extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor Ineke: The burrata is the only conflict here. To supplement, provide a bowl of good quality hummus (seasoned with lemon, salt, and chilli) as a creamy, plant-based alternative for her.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the confit tomatoes (Prep Ahead): Preheat your oven to 150°C (130°C fan). Place the tomatoes in a snug-fitting baking dish. Tuck the smashed garlic cloves and thyme sprigs in amongst them. Drizzle generously with the olive oil, sprinkle over the sugar, a good pinch of salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Toss gently. Roast for 1.5–2 hours, until the tomatoes are softened, slightly shrivelled, and intensely flavourful. Let them cool completely in their oil. This can be done up to three days in advance and stored in a sealed jar in the fridge.\nFor the crispy capers (Prep Ahead): Pat the drained capers completely dry with a paper towel—this is crucial for crisping and preventing oil splatters. Heat the sunflower oil in a small saucepan over a medium-high heat. Test the oil with one caper; it should sizzle immediately. Carefully add the rest of the capers and fry for 2–3 minutes, until they have ‘bloomed’ and look crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. They will crisp up further as they cool. Store in an airtight container.\nTo assemble: Let the burrata come to room temperature for 20 minutes for the best flavour and texture. Place it on a platter and gently tear it open. Spoon the confit tomatoes and their glorious oil all around it. Scatter with the fresh basil leaves and, finally, the crispy capers. Serve with the bread and crackers on the side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are few things in life as comforting as a roast chicken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAdapting for Ineke: This meal requires a parallel main course. You will roast Ineke’s potatoes on a separate tray with olive oil and provide a beautiful piece of pan-seared fish instead of chicken. A bright salsa verde will replace the chicken gravy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 large free-range chicken (around 1.6kg)\n700g baby potatoes, scrubbed\n2 lemons\n1 whole bulb of garlic, halved crossways\n4 sprigs of thyme, plus extra for potatoes\n\nFor the Herb Butter:\n\n80g unsalted butter, at room temperature\n4 cloves garlic, crushed\n1 tbsp thyme leaves, finely chopped\nZest of 1 lemon\n1 tsp salt\n½ tsp black pepper\n\nFor Ineke’s Main:\n\n1 large fillet of fish salmon\n1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for potatoes\n1 clove garlic, crushed\nA few sprigs of thyme\n\n\n\n\nFor the Greens:\n\n400g Tenderstem broccoli or green beans\n1 tbsp olive oil\n1 clove garlic, thinly sliced\n\nFor the Gravy:\n\n1 tbsp cornflour\n250ml chicken stock or water\n\nFor the Salsa Verde (for fish):\n\n1 large bunch of flat-leaf parsley\n2 tbsp capers, drained\n1 clove garlic\nJuice of ½ a lemon\n4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare the chicken (On the Day): Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C fan). First, make the herb butter by mixing all its ingredients in a small bowl.\nPlace the chicken breast-side down on a board. Using sturdy kitchen shears, cut along both sides of the backbone to remove it. Flip the chicken over and press down firmly on the breastbone to flatten it. Pat the chicken dry all over with paper towels.\nGently loosen the skin over the breasts and thighs and push half of the herb butter underneath. Rub the remaining butter all over the outside of the chicken. Season generously.\nPrepare the potatoes: Cut any larger potatoes in half and place them in a pot of cold salted water. Bring to the boil and cook for 10 minutes until slightly tender. Drain well and shake the colander to rough up their edges.\nRoast: Tip the par-boiled potatoes into a large roasting tin. Add the halved garlic bulb and extra thyme sprigs. Drizzle with a little olive oil. Place a wire rack over the potatoes and place the spatchcocked chicken on top. Squeeze the juice of one lemon over the chicken. Roast for 50–60 minutes, or until the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pierced.\n\n\nFor Ineke, toss her portion of potatoes on a separate, smaller baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil, a few smashed garlic cloves, and thyme.\n\n\nRest and finish: Remove the chicken to a board to rest for 15 minutes. You can place the potatoes back in the oven to crisp up further if needed. While the chicken rests, sauté your greens with the sliced garlic until tender-crisp.\nFor the gravy: Spoon off most of the fat from the roasting tin. Place the tin over a medium heat. Mix the cornflour with a little cold water to make a slurry, then whisk it into the tin with the chicken stock, scraping up all the caramelised bits from the bottom. Simmer for a few minutes until thickened.\n\nFor the salsa verde, blitz all the ingredients in a food processor until you have a rough sauce. Season to taste.\n\nCarve the chicken and serve with the incredible potatoes, greens, and the pan gravy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis starter is an exercise in umami. The seeds on top add a nice crunch.\n\n\n\n\n\n1 sheet of all-butter puff pastry, thawed\n1 egg, beaten\n1 tbsp sunflower seeds (or a mix of seeds)\n\nFor the Mushroom Pâté:\n\n2 tbsp olive oil\n500g mixed mushrooms (like portabellini and exotic), roughly chopped\n2 shallots or 1 small onion, finely chopped\n2 cloves garlic, crushed\n1 tbsp thyme leaves\n1 tsp soy sauce\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake the mushroom pâté (Prep Ahead): Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook for 5 minutes until soft. Add the chopped mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10–15 minutes. The mushrooms will first release a lot of water; continue cooking until all the water has evaporated and the mushrooms start to caramelise and turn golden brown.\nAdd the garlic and thyme and cook for another minute until fragrant.
