    "text": "Starter: Salmon with Green Pea Sauce and Charred Broccoli\nIngredients: - 6 salmon fillets (about 150g each, skin on) - 400g frozen green peas, thawed - handful of mint, washed - 200ml heavy cream - 1 small garlic clove, crushed - Zest and juice of 1 lemon - Salt and freshly ground black pepper - 500g broccoli, cut into florets - 2 tbsp olive oil - 1 tbsp chopped fresh dill for garnish\nInstructions: 1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).\n\nSeason the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Place them on a baking tray, skin side down, and roast for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked to your desired level.\nIn the meantime, prepare the green pea sauce. In a blender, combine the peas, heavy cream, garlic, lemon zest, and juice. Blend until smooth, then season with salt and pepper to taste. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of water to thin it out.\nIn a large bowl, toss the broccoli florets with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Heat a large grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the broccoli, turning occasionally, until charred and tender, about 5-7 minutes.\nTo serve, spoon some green pea sauce onto each plate, top with a salmon fillet, and arrange the charred broccoli alongside. Garnish with fresh dill."

In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil, za’atar, sumac, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
