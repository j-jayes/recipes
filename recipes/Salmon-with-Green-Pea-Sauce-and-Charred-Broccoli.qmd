## Starter: Salmon with Green Pea Sauce and Charred Broccoli

Ingredients:
- 6 salmon fillets (about 150g each, skin on)

- 400g frozen green peas, thawed

- handful of mint, washed

- 200ml heavy cream

- 1 small garlic clove, crushed

- Zest and juice of 1 lemon

- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

- 500g broccoli, cut into florets

- 2 tbsp olive oil

- 1 tbsp chopped fresh dill for garnish

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Place them on a baking tray, skin side down, and roast for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked to your desired level.

3. In the meantime, prepare the green pea sauce. In a blender, combine the peas, heavy cream, garlic, lemon zest, and juice. Blend until smooth, then season with salt and pepper to taste. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of water to thin it out.

4. In a large bowl, toss the broccoli florets with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Heat a large grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the broccoli, turning occasionally, until charred and tender, about 5-7 minutes.

5. To serve, spoon some green pea sauce onto each plate, top with a salmon fillet, and arrange the charred broccoli alongside. Garnish with fresh dill.

## Main Course: Beef Roast with Ottolenghi-inspired Roast Potatoes

Ingredients:
- 1.5kg beef roast (such as topside or rib-eye)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1.2kg small waxy potatoes, peeled and halved
- 2 tbsp za'atar
- 1 tbsp sumac
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 3 tbsp chopped fresh parsley

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).

2. Season the beef roast generously with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a large ovenproof skillet or roasting pan over medium-high heat. Sear the beef on all sides until browned, about 3-4 minutes per side.

3. Transfer the skillet or roasting pan to the oven and roast the beef for 50-60 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast reads 52°C (125°F) for medium-rare. Adjust the cooking time if you prefer your beef more well-done.

4. Remove the beef from the oven, tent with foil, and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.

5. While the beef is resting, prepare the roast potatoes. In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil, za'atar, sumac, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Spread the potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast for 35-40 minutes, or until golden and crispy, turning them halfway through cooking.

6. To serve, slice the beef roast and arrange on a platter with the roasted potatoes. Sprinkle the potatoes with lemon zest and chopped parsley.
