### Friday Lunch: Deconstructed "Club Kloof" Platter

This is not so much a recipe as an assembly. Slow-roast the tomatoes until they are sweet and jammy. The capers are fried until they burst open like salty, crispy flowers.

:::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Ingredients

**For the Confit Tomatoes:**

- 800g cherry tomatoes

- 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and smashed

- 4 sprigs of thyme

- 120ml extra virgin olive oil

- 1 tsp light brown sugar

- Salt and black pepper

**For the Crispy Capers:**

- 4 tbsp capers in brine, drained

- 100ml sunflower oil

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
<br>

**For Assembly:**

- 1 large ball of fresh burrata or fior di latte

- A generous handful of fresh basil leaves

- High-quality sourdough or ciabatta

- Gluten-free crackers

- Your best extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling

:::{.callout-note icon="leaf"}
For Ineke: The burrata is the only conflict here. To supplement, provide a bowl of good quality hummus (seasoned with lemon, salt, and chilli) as a creamy, plant-based alternative for her.
:::

#### Method

1.  **For the confit tomatoes (Prep Ahead):** Preheat your oven to 150°C (130°C fan). Place the tomatoes in a snug-fitting baking dish. Tuck the smashed garlic cloves and thyme sprigs in amongst them. Drizzle generously with the olive oil, sprinkle over the sugar, a good pinch of salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Toss gently. Roast for 1.5–2 hours, until the tomatoes are softened, slightly shrivelled, and intensely flavourful. Let them cool completely in their oil. This can be done up to three days in advance and stored in a sealed jar in the fridge.

2.  **For the crispy capers (Prep Ahead):** Pat the drained capers completely dry with a paper towel—this is crucial for crisping and preventing oil splatters. Heat the sunflower oil in a small saucepan over a medium-high heat. Test the oil with one caper; it should sizzle immediately. Carefully add the rest of the capers and fry for 2–3 minutes, until they have ‘bloomed’ and look crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. They will crisp up further as they cool. Store in an airtight container.

3.  **To assemble:** Let the burrata come to room temperature for 20 minutes for the best flavour and texture. Place it on a platter and gently tear it open. Spoon the confit tomatoes and their glorious oil all around it. Scatter with the fresh basil leaves and, finally, the crispy capers. Serve with the bread and crackers on the side.

### Friday Dinner: Spatchcock Chicken with Potatoes in its Drippings

There are few things in life as comforting as a roast chicken.

:::{.callout-note icon="fish"}
**Adapting for Ineke:** This meal requires a parallel main course. You will roast **Ineke's** potatoes on a separate tray with olive oil and provide a beautiful piece of pan-seared fish instead of chicken. A bright salsa verde will replace the chicken gravy.
:::

:::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Ingredients

- 1 large free-range chicken (around 1.6kg)

- 700g baby potatoes, scrubbed

- 2 lemons

- 1 whole bulb of garlic, halved crossways

- 4 sprigs of thyme, plus extra for potatoes

**For the Herb Butter:**

- 80g unsalted butter, at room temperature

- 4 cloves garlic, crushed

- 1 tbsp thyme leaves, finely chopped

- Zest of 1 lemon

- 1 tsp salt

- ½ tsp black pepper

**For Ineke's Main:**

- 1 large fillet of fish salmon

- 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for potatoes

- 1 clove garlic, crushed

- A few sprigs of thyme

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
<br>

**For the Greens:**

- 400g Tenderstem broccoli or green beans

- 1 tbsp olive oil

- 1 clove garlic, thinly sliced

**For the Gravy:**

- 1 tbsp cornflour

- 250ml chicken stock or water

**For the Salsa Verde (for fish):**

- 1 large bunch of flat-leaf parsley

- 2 tbsp capers, drained

- 1 clove garlic

- Juice of ½ a lemon

- 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

:::
:::

#### Method

1.  **Prepare the chicken (On the Day):** Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C fan). First, make the herb butter by mixing all its ingredients in a small bowl.

2.  Place the chicken breast-side down on a board. Using sturdy kitchen shears, cut along both sides of the backbone to remove it. Flip the chicken over and press down firmly on the breastbone to flatten it. Pat the chicken dry all over with paper towels.

3.  Gently loosen the skin over the breasts and thighs and push half of the herb butter underneath. Rub the remaining butter all over the outside of the chicken. Season generously.

4.  **Prepare the potatoes:** Cut any larger potatoes in half and place them in a pot of cold salted water. Bring to the boil and cook for 10 minutes until slightly tender. Drain well and shake the colander to rough up their edges.

5.  **Roast:** Tip the par-boiled potatoes into a large roasting tin. Add the halved garlic bulb and extra thyme sprigs. Drizzle with a little olive oil. Place a wire rack over the potatoes and place the spatchcocked chicken on top. Squeeze the juice of one lemon over the chicken. Roast for 50–60 minutes, or until the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pierced.

- **For Ineke, toss her portion of potatoes on a separate, smaller baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil, a few smashed garlic cloves, and thyme.**

6.  **Rest and finish:** Remove the chicken to a board to rest for 15 minutes. You can place the potatoes back in the oven to crisp up further if needed. While the chicken rests, sauté your greens with the sliced garlic until tender-crisp.

7.  **For the gravy:** Spoon off most of the fat from the roasting tin. Place the tin over a medium heat. Mix the cornflour with a little cold water to make a slurry, then whisk it into the tin with the chicken stock, scraping up all the caramelised bits from the bottom. Simmer for a few minutes until thickened.

For the salsa verde, blitz all the ingredients in a food processor until you have a rough sauce. Season to taste.

8.  Carve the chicken and serve with the incredible potatoes, greens, and the pan gravy.

### Saturday Lunch: Mushroom Pâté & Seed Tartlets on Puff Pastry

This starter is an exercise in umami. The seeds on top add a nice crunch.

:::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Ingredients

- 1 sheet of all-butter puff pastry, thawed

- 1 egg, beaten

- 1 tbsp sunflower seeds (or a mix of seeds)

**For the Mushroom Pâté:**

- 2 tbsp olive oil

- 500g mixed mushrooms (like portabellini and exotic), roughly chopped

- 2 shallots or 1 small onion, finely chopped

- 2 cloves garlic, crushed

- 1 tbsp thyme leaves

- 1 tsp soy sauce

- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
:::
:::

#### Method

1.  **Make the mushroom pâté (Prep Ahead):** Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook for 5 minutes until soft. Add the chopped mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10–15 minutes. The mushrooms will first release a lot of water; continue cooking until all the water has evaporated and the mushrooms start to caramelise and turn golden brown.

2.  Add the garlic and thyme and cook for another minute until fragrant. Add the soy sauce and a generous amount of salt and pepper. Stir well.

3.  Transfer the mushroom mixture to a food processor. Pulse a few times until you have a coarse, spreadable pâté. You don't want a perfectly smooth puree. Let it cool completely. This can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 days.

4.  **Assemble and bake (On the Day):** Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C fan). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

5.  Unroll the puff pastry sheet. You can either cut it into small squares or rounds for individual tartlets, or leave it whole for a larger tart to slice. Place the pastry on the prepared baking sheet.

6.  Spread the cooled mushroom pâté over the pastry, leaving a 1cm border around the edge.

7.  Brush the border with the beaten egg. Sprinkle the sunflower seeds over the mushroom pâté.

8.  Bake for 15–20 minutes, until the pastry is puffed up, deeply golden, and crisp. Serve warm.

### Sunday Lunch Starter: Tempura Cauliflower with Tahini & Chilli Crunch

Inspired by a meal at Kima in CPH.

:::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Ingredients

- 1 head of cauliflower, broken into bite-sized florets

- 1 litre sunflower oil, for frying

**For the Tempura Batter:**

- 100g plain flour (or GF flour mix)

- 50g cornflour

- ½ tsp salt

- 200ml ice-cold sparkling water

**For the Tahini Sauce & Garnish:**

- 3 tbsp tahini

- 1 clove garlic, crushed

- Juice of ½ a lemon

- 2–3 tbsp water, to thin

- Salt

- Chilli Crunch, to serve

- Handful of fresh coriander or parsley, chopped

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
:::
:::

#### Method

1.  **Make the tahini sauce (Prep Ahead):** In a small bowl, whisk together the tahini, crushed garlic, and lemon juice. It will seize up and become thick—this is normal. Gradually whisk in the cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until you have a smooth, pourable sauce the consistency of single cream. Season with salt.

2.  **Prepare for frying (On the Day):** Heat the sunflower oil in a large, deep saucepan to 180°C. If you don't have a thermometer, a small drop of batter should sizzle and turn golden in about 30 seconds.

3.  **Make the batter:** Just before you are ready to fry, whisk the flour, cornflour, and salt together in a bowl. Gently pour in the ice-cold sparkling water and whisk *very lightly*. A few lumps are perfectly fine; over-mixing will make the batter heavy.

4.  **Fry the cauliflower:** Working in batches, dip the cauliflower florets into the batter, letting any excess drip off. Carefully place them in the hot oil. Fry for 3–4 minutes, turning occasionally, until light golden and very crisp. Do not overcrowd the pan.

5.  Remove the fried florets with a slotted spoon to a wire rack to drain. Sprinkle immediately with a little salt.

6.  **To serve:** Arrange the hot tempura cauliflower on a platter. Drizzle generously with the tahini sauce, spoon over some of the chilli crunch, and finish with a scattering of fresh herbs. Serve immediately.

### Sunday Lunch Main: Fragrant Thai Curry with Pan-Seared Halibut

Based on Kathy's birthday meal at the Pot Luck Club.

:::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Ingredients

- 2 x 180g halibut fillets, skin on

- 200g raw, peeled prawns

- 1 tbsp sunflower oil

- Steamed jasmine rice, to serve

**For the Curry Sauce:**

- 1 tbsp coconut or sunflower oil

- 2 cloves garlic, finely grated

- 2cm piece of ginger, finely grated

- 3-4 tbsp red Thai curry paste

- 400ml can full-fat coconut milk

- 200ml vegetable or chicken stock

- 1 tsp brown sugar

- Juice of 1 lime

**To Finish:**

- A large handful of fresh coriander, roughly chopped

- A few fresh basil leaves (Thai basil if you can find it)

- 1 fresh red chilli, thinly sliced (optional)

- Lime wedges, to serve

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
:::
:::

#### Method

1.  **Start the jasmine rice** according to packet instructions so it is ready when the curry is.

2.  **Build the curry base:** Heat the coconut oil in a saucepan or wok over a medium heat. 
Add the grated garlic and ginger and fry for a minute until fragrant. Add the curry paste and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring, until it darkens and becomes very aromatic.

3.  Pour in the coconut milk and stock, whisking to combine with the paste. Bring to a gentle simmer, then add the brown sugar. Let it simmer gently for 10 minutes for the flavours to meld.

4.  **Cook the seafood:** While the sauce simmers, prepare the halibut. Pat the skin completely dry with a paper towel and season the fillets with salt. Heat the sunflower oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Place the halibut skin-side down and press gently with a spatula for 30 seconds to ensure it's flat against the pan. Cook for 3–4 minutes, until the skin is golden and very crisp. Flip and cook for another 1–2 minutes, depending on the thickness, until just cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.

5.  **Finish the sauce:** Add the raw prawns to the simmering curry sauce and cook for just 2–3 minutes, until they turn pink and opaque. Stir in the fresh lime juice.

6.  **To serve:** Ladle the jasmine rice into shallow bowls. Spoon the fragrant curry and prawns over the rice. Gently place a piece of crispy-skinned halibut on top of each bowl. Garnish generously with the fresh coriander, basil, and sliced chilli. Serve immediately with extra lime wedges on the side.
